# TTS Porject Board

## Workflow Ceremonies

The team plans on working in an agile way, focused on Kanban with agile ceremonies. Based on the team being new, no designated person responsible for any one piece of work, the team needs to meet more often than it currently is as a group outside of any workflow ceromony to co-work through issues that in progress. 

### Grooming
The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the backlog grooming provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning. 

At this point the cards are given actionable tasks and acceptance criteria with a user story.

### Sprint Planning
Determine which stories should be targeted for completion in the upcoming sprint by adding them to a sprint backlog list. 

### Retros
An opportunity for the team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

### Sprint Review
A chance to look back and see what has been done and to communicate that with stakeholders. 

## Epics
- Create an issue for the epic
- Label it with the label "epic"
- Move it to the epic column
- Create a label related to that epic and use that label for related issues

## Cards

### Labels
- Use whatever labels works for you!
  - John plans on using labels related to the Cybersecurity Framework 
    - This helps him with tracking progress 
  - Alyssa plans on using labels related to the domain of work that fits her skills 
    - This helps her prioritize, sort & pull from

### Assignments
- If you would like to work on an issue, assign yourself to it before it gets to the ready column

### Card template:

> **Title:** 
> 
> **User Story:**
> 
> **Implementation:**
> * [ ] [first thing to do]
> * [ ] [another thing to do]
>
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
##Boards
### Columns 
**Definition of "Done"**

An agile "Definition of Done" (DoD) captures the team's agreed-upon standards for how we get work done at a consistent level of quality. Having a DoD ensures that non-functional requirements (NFRs) don't have to be re-litigated for every piece of work taken on, cards can be focused on just the relevant details, and new team members aren't surprised by assumed expectations of their colleagues.

At our sprint reviews, we celebrate work that has reached the "Done" column and is of interest to our users, teammates, or other people apart from the squad that built it. 

**Column exit criteria**

For Tech Portfolio, our DoD is broken up into a set of statements that should be true for each card before it moves to the next column on the board. 

Before advancing a card from one column to the next on the board, it should meet the "exit criteria" for the current column, which are listed below.

- New Issues (where reported issues, and newly-identified stories appear)
- Icebox (where they go when they are not planned to get attention any time soon)
- Grooming (when they're being refined for implementation)
- Backlog/Ready (when they are sequenced alongside other stories prioritized for attention)
- In Progress (when someone is actively working on the issue)
- Blocked/waiting (when there's a dependency on someone responding or something happening outside the team)
- Done (when work warrants demonstration to stakeholders and is awaiting the next sprint review)

#### New Issues

- Relevant points from any discussion in the comments is captured in the initial post.
- Decision is made to move to the Backlog or Icebox columns, or close.

#### Backlog/Ready

- Indicate the intended benefit and who the story is for in one of these forms:
TBD

#### Grooming
- Has testable/demoable Acceptance Criteria that we expect to be able to check off to help us understand when the work is done. 
- Discussed by the team and implementation sketched (use more checklists here).
- We believe the benefit of the story is easily deliverable within in a few days of concentrated work (otherwise, split it into smaller stories!)
- Everyone that would like to work on it has been assigned



### Ready

- No info or assistance is needed from outside the team to start work and likely finish it.
- There's capacity available to work on the story (e.g., this column is a buffer of shovel-ready work).

### In Progress

- Acceptance criteria are demonstrably met.
- Relevant tasks complete, irrelevant checklists removed or captured on a new story.

### Awaiting Acceptance

- Waiting for other members on the team to validate work product
- Form/Document submitted and waiting on other 

### Done

- The work is user-visible and announceable at any time.
